NOTE 1 For example: in the general case Pc = 0,95 or Pc = 95 % are both acceptable, but Pc = 2s is not. Indeed the ‘ns’ format assumes a Gaussian distribution; using this notation for a general statistical distribution can cause wrong assumptions to be made. For a Gaussian the 95 % (2s) bound is twice as far from the mean as the 68 % (1s) bound, but this relation does not hold for a general distribution.
