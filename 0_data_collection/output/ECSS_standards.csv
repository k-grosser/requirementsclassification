ECSS-E-ST-60-10_1020004,"Using the ‘ns’ notation for expressing probabilities shall be restricted to cases where the hypothesis of Gaussian distribution holds.     NOTE 1 For example: in the general case Pc = 0,95 or Pc = 95 % are both acceptable, but Pc = 2s is not. Indeed the ‘ns’ format assumes a Gaussian distribution; using this notation for a general statistical distribution can cause wrong assumptions to be made. For a Gaussian the 95 % (2s) bound is twice as far from the mean as the 68 % (1s) bound, but this relation does not hold for a general distribution.     NOTE 2 Upon certain conditions the assumption of Gaussian distribution is not to be excluded a priory.
